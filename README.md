# Java Learning

This repository serves as my learning journal for mastering Java. Even though I already have a solid understanding of Java, I decided to revisit the fundamentals to deepen my understanding. I believe that to truly grasp a concept, it should be studied thoroughly and often multiple times. This process will ensure I have a strong foundation before diving into more advanced topics.

## Repository Structure

- `fundamentals/` - Core Java concepts (variables, loops, classes, collections, exceptions).
- `oop/` - Object-oriented programming (OOP, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces).
- `collections/` - Java collections (List, Set, Map, Stream API).
- `exceptions/` - Exception handling, custom exceptions.
- Other folders will be added as I progress in learning.

## Why am I doing this?

Although I already know Java well, revisiting the basics will help solidify my understanding and ensure I don't miss any critical aspects. This approach will strengthen my foundation for more advanced topics like Spring framework, allowing me to progress as a more skilled developer.
