# Java Learning

This repository serves as my learning journal for mastering Java. Even though I already have a solid understanding of Java, I decided to revisit the fundamentals to deepen my understanding. I believe that to truly grasp a concept, it should be studied thoroughly and often multiple times. This process will ensure I have a strong foundation before diving into more advanced topics.

## Why am I doing this?

Although I already know Java well, revisiting the basics will help solidify my understanding and ensure I don't miss any critical aspects. This approach will strengthen my foundation for more advanced topics like Spring framework, allowing me to progress as a more skilled developer.
