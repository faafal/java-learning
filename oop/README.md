# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In this folder, I focus on object-oriented programming principles. OOP is a fundamental paradigm in Java, and understanding it well is essential for writing maintainable and reusable code.

## Topics Covered:
- **Inheritance**: Understanding how one class can inherit from another.
- **Polymorphism**: Learning how Java supports polymorphism with method overriding and interfaces.
- **Encapsulation**: The concept of keeping data safe and private, providing access through methods.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity and showing only relevant details.
